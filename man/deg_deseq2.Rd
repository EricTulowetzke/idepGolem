\arguments{
\item{raw_counts}{Matrix of raw counts before processing for
gene expression data}

\item{max_p_limma}{Significant p-value to use for the fold-change
values}

\item{min_fc_limma}{Minimum fold-change to include in the results}

\item{selected_comparisons}{Comparisons being analyzed in the DEG
analysis}

\item{sample_info}{Experiment file information for grouping}

\item{model_factors}{Vector of selected factors and interaction terms
from the model design}

\item{block_factor}{The selected factors for batch effect}

\item{reference_levels}{Vector of reference levels to use for the
selected factors}

\item{threshold_wald_test}{TRUE/FALSE to use threshold-based Wald test
to test null hypothesis that the absolute value of fold-change is bigger than 
a value.. Default is FALSE.}

\item{independent_filtering}{TRUE/FALSE to conduct independent filtering. 
Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
The return value is the results of the DEG analysis. These
 results are filtered and formatted by the limma_value function.
  results, a data frame with up or down regulated genes for all comparisons
  comparisons, a vectors holding comparison_names,
  exp_type, a character holding experimental design or error messages.
  top_genes, a list, each elements hold the lfc & FDR for a comparison
}
\description{
Used in the limma_value function to perform DEG analysis using the
DESeq2 package. It is not recommended to use this function on its own.
